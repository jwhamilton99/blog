Yesterday was the last day for the Femto fundraiser, and I just made the donation. The total came out to $74.59, which I just rounded up to an even $75. You can see the day-by-day breakdown on the [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1F96IpzNAYbhM9mVr5BX88gy8SGU34xcvXlBjJwejd_8/edit?usp=sharing), and the donation confirmation [here](https://twitter.com/femtoeditor/status/1273692015692328962).

Thank you so much to everyone who participated.
