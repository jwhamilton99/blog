If you visit my site, you may have noticed some color changes. For the entire duration of [Pride Month](https://lgbt.wikia.org/wiki/Gay_and_Lesbian_Pride_Month), this site will show the colors of various Pride flags (the full list is [here](https://twitter.com/jwhamilton_/status/1264773859099770880))). If you're interested in the code side of this, you can see the script [here](https://www.jwhamilton.co/scripts/pride.js). I myself am bisexual, and I wear that proudly. I know this is a tiny way to celebrate on a site that gets little traffic, but this is my little corner of the Internet that I have full control over, and that's honestly really comforting right now. And yes, I did wait until midnight today to post this. I'm excited.

So happy Pride Month to all the wonderful people who are out, in the closet, or figuring themselves out. Stay safe.
