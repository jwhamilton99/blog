Alright, so I'm realizing that updating posts later doesn't work. I use [NetNewsWire](https://ranchero.com/netnewswire/) as my RSS reader, and it doesn't refresh with the updated section. I can't say if this exists for other readers, but you can never be too safe. I'll stop doing updates on posts in the future.
