I think everyone has at least some idea of the shit that's happening in America right now, and it seriously pained me to just sit idly by while people were out there fighting against this oppression. I would attend a protest if I could, but sadly circumstances don't allow. I'm still trying to help in any way I can, which is why I'm doing another fundraiser. 

From tomorrow, June 3rd, to June 17th, 100% of all proceeds from [Femto](https://www.femtoeditor.com), my text editor (and the only paid app I make), will be donated to organizations that fight against racism and police brutality. I learned about [this ActBlue page](https://secure.actblue.com/donate/ab_mn) from Christian Selig, the developer of [Apollo](https://apolloapp.io/), who showed an incredible amount of his own generosity earlier today. You can learn more about this fundraiser on [femtoeditor.com](https://www.femtoeditor.com), and follow the running total for the next 2 weeks. Purchases from new users and tips from existing users will be counted toward this total.

Thank you so much for your support, and please encourage your friends and loved ones to donate in any form. Stay safe out there.
