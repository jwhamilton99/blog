This past Christmas, I was gifted a [10oz Ember Smart Mug](https://ember.com/products/ember-mug-2?variant=30843977826389) by my [wonderful brother](https://www.twitter.com/_brianhamilton). After running out of apple cider to drink late at night, I turned to my other favorite hot drink: hot chocolate. After seeing that the recipe on the back of the Hershey's Cocoa Powder package would make *waaaay* too much for my needs, I scaled the recipe down to perfectly fit a 10oz mug like the Ember. You're gonna need a scale for this.

Ingredients:
* 1.25oz granulated sugar
* 0.5oz cocoa powder
* 0.75oz water
* A pinch of kosher salt
* 7.5oz milk (I just use 2%, you could probably use a dairy-free substitute here)
* A few drops of vanilla extract

Directions:
* Combine sugar, cocoa, water, and salt in a saucepan. Heat until it's turned into a nice chocolatey paste, scraping down the sides and making sure it's not burning.
* Stir in milk and vanilla, and the heat to your desired temperature (I use an instant-read thermometer to make sure it's at a nice 135ÂºF). Make sure the milk doesn't boil. I don't know why, but the Hershey's recipe says to not do that.
* Enjoy!
